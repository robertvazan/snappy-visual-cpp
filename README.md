# Snappy for Visual C++ #

**UNMAINTAINED**: This library is no longer maintained, because I rarely use Windows or C++ these days. It has not been updated in years. You are welcome to adopt the library if you find it useful.

This is a Windows port of [Snappy compression algorithm](https://google.github.io/snappy/).
